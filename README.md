## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

As simple as it might be, i learned how to escape tags to prevent a code snippet(in this case some of the quizzes' options) from being read/rendered as a piece of code and affecting overall code funtionality.

### Continued development

Writing simpler and more refined code.
